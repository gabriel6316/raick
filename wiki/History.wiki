I would like to say a few words about the history of the project and why is it the 2-nd version of RAICK.
==<font color="#006666">H.A.I.C.K.</font>==
It all started with HAICK, which stands for _Homunculus Artificial Intelligence Creation Kit_. At first it was just an experiment- i was trying to make something that would present the AI data in a more convenient and easy-to-use way. At some point the framework got mature enough to be shown to the public, so i began writing the manual. After posting it on the forum of the Russian private server [http://www.asgardro.com AsgardRO](on which a had player at that time) the framework started to gain popularity in the Russian RO community.<br><br>

With the release of mercenaries i thought that it would be a good idea to make something similar for them and since anyway most of the code would have been the same i decided to merge this new functionality with HAICK. However, adding something that would only mirror HAICK would have been too boring, so i developed a feature that allowed homunculus to communicate with mercenary and vice-versa.<br><br>

After some time i've decided to introduce my creation to a larger public. With this intention in mind i've set 2 ambitious goals for myself:
  * To rewrite RAICK, simplifying everything that can still be simplified
  * To write a new simple guide in English not only for the RAICK itself, but for the Lua language, AI scripting and programming as a whole
This way RAICK project becomes not only a framework, but also something like an online tutorial for learning AI scripting.<br>
So, if you are one of those, who want to learn how to make your own AI's with less effort then this is certainly the place for you!
