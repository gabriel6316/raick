===<font color="#A30000" face="Century Gothic">27.08.11</font> | <font color="#006600">2.1.0</font>===
  * Fixed buggy error location tracking code.
  * Added Homunculus S ID's and names for probable future update.
  * Added custom mercenary support.
    * _Note: Some skill handlers have moved to the `Common Skills` file due to the fact that they are now used also by the new mercenaries. This is not a problem, since you can define any handlers in any file, but if you would like to update your skill files simply backup your AI and reinstall it. After that you can copy/put everything in its place._
  * Added 3^rd^ job support.
  * Added `mob` query to `is` method of `Actor` object(works also with `Mercenary AI`).
  * `"Morroc Flying"` mob is renamed to `"Morroc Winged"`.
  * Made some other improvements to the inner structure.

  * After extensive field testing i've found some very annoying bugs that made the framework practically unusable. Now they are fixed.
  * I've had plans to add custom mercenaries, Homunculus S skills and 3^rd^ job recognition, but since the project is highly unpopular i've found it a waste on time(at least at this point). If you really like the framework and want to use it with the new stuff, then send [http://forums.irowiki.org/member.php?u=15157 me] a PM on _iRO Wiki Forum_. Maybe i'll reconsider *;)*
